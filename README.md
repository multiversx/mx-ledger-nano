# MultiversX App for the Ledger Nano S

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/ElrondNetwork/ledger-elrond.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/ElrondNetwork/ledger-elrond)

## Introduction

This is the official MultiversX wallet app for the [Ledger Nano S](https://www.ledgerwallet.com/products/ledger-nano-s).

## Prerequisites

### Latest firmware

Before proceeding with the installation, please make sure your device is up-to-date with the latest firmware.

### Connectivity

Furthermore, you need to configure your OS to enable the connectivity with the Nano S device. For example, on Linux, you have to issue the following command:

```
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LedgerHQ/udev-rules/master/add_udev_rules.sh | sudo bash
```

For other platforms, please have a look on [this article](https://support.ledger.com/hc/en-us/articles/115005165269) from ledger.com.

### Python package `ledgerblue`

```
pip3 install --user --upgrade --no-cache-dir ledgerblue
```

Note that `python3` and `pip3` are required in order to install `ledgerblue`.


## Loading a released version onto the device

Download the latest `*.hex` file from our [releases page](https://github.com/multiversx/mx-ledger-nano/releases). If `wget` is available on your machine, then:

```
export APP_VERSION=1.0.18

wget https://github.com/multiversx/mx-ledger-nano/releases/download/v${APP_VERSION}/elrond-ledger-app-v${APP_VERSION}.hex
```

Now that you've downloaded the app and `ledgerblue` package is available, let's load the app on the device:

```
export APP_VERSION=1.0.18

python3 -m ledgerblue.loadApp --curve ed25519 --path "44'/508'" --appFlags 0x240 --tlv --targetId 0x31100004 --targetVersion=1.6.0 --delete --appName Elrond --appVersion ${APP_VERSION} --fileName elrond-ledger-app-v${APP_VERSION}.hex --dataSize 64 --icon "010000000000ffffffffffffffffff37ecdffbeff7f7eff7eff7eff7efeff7dffb37ecffffffffffff"
```

To remove the app from the device, issue the following command:

```
python3 -m ledgerblue.deleteApp --targetId 0x31100004 --appName Elrond
```

## ESDT tokens support

In order to perform whitelisted tokens operation, first an ESDT data providing is needed.

A concatenation between the following fields has to be sent by using INS `0x08`:
`ticker len, ticker, id_len, id, decimals, chain_id_len, chain_id, signature`

The signature is generated by signing the sha256 hash of `ticker len, ticker, id_len, id, decimals, chain_id_len, chain_id` with a private key managed by Elrond team.

## Testing

The `testApp` folder contains a sample *Go* application to prepare MultiversX transactions, which you can sign using the Ledger device. The signed transactions are then dispatched to the [MultiversX Proxy](https://api.multiversx.com), in order to be processed and saved on the blockchain.

Download the latest `ElrondTestApp*` file from our [releases page](https://github.com/multiversx/mx-ledger-nano/releases). Linux, MacOS and Windows are supported. Then execute the file while the device is connected to your computer. You will be requested to enter transaction details and then continue with the signing step.

Before running the application, you need to mark it as executable on Linux / MacOS:

```
chmod +x ./ElrondTestApp*
```

Also, please note that on Windows you might receive the _Unknown publisher_ warning from the [UAC facility](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_Account_Control) when you first run the _testApp_.

## Development environment: building and installing

### Build and load applications to device via ledger-app-builder Docker image
As an alternative to install and maintain many packages on your machine, Ledger applications can be built and loaded 
into the device by using the _ledger-app-builder_. How to build it: https://developers.ledger.com/docs/nano-app/build/

After _ledger-app-builder_ is installed, go to `ledger-elrond` root and run this command:
```
docker run --rm -ti -v "/dev/bus/usb:/dev/bus/usb" -v "$(realpath .):/app" --privileged ledger-app-builder:latest
```

When in the container, run this to load the app onto the device:
```$ make load```

Or this to remove it:
```$ make delete```

Reference: https://developers.ledger.com/docs/nano-app/load/

### Install all dependencies (not recommended)
To build locally, you must first clone this repository, then set up the development environment:

```$ source prepare-devenv s```

This could take a while. Then, load the app as follows:

```$ make load```

To remove the app from the device, run:

```$ make delete```
